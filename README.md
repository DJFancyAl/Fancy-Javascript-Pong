## Inspiration

This game was designed to provide a dyanmic and fast-paced gaming experience. I set out to create a game with a lot of motion where the player would have to constantly be engaged with their computer's keyboard. I wanted the game to move so quick that the player couldn't look away, but I also wanted to game to be endlessly playable. Then "AHA!" It's time to make a pong game...

### The Game

Playing this game is easy. Winning it on the other hand...not so much. The objective is to score 5 points before your opponent by getting the ball past their paddle. Once a player has scored 5 points - the match will is won! Want a rematch?? Match score will be kept also, so you can play as many games as you like.
